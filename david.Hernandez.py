# Project requires TWO functions:
# 1. rect_area (length, width) which will return the area of a rectangle
# 2. rect_solid_area (length, width, height) which will return the area of a solid rectangular object

# The following four lines are just there to make the code work without errors until functions are added

 # 2 function of # 2. rect_solid_area (length, width, height) which will return the area of a solid rectangular object
